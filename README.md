# 2048-game-updated-version
Overview
This is a Python implementation of the popular 2048 game using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. Players can use the arrow keys to move tiles up, down, left, or right. Additionally, this version of the game includes two extra features: the ability to undo the last move and a shuffle power-up that randomly rearranges the tiles.
